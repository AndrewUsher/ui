# FadeUp

The FadeUp component is a React component that provides a fade-up animation effect to its child elements. It's designed to enhance the visual appeal of your application by smoothly revealing content as it enters the viewport.


### Default Usage

<Canvas of={FadeUpStories.Default} />

This example shows the default behavior of the FadeUp component.

### Custom Duration 

<Canvas of={FadeUpStories.WithLongDuration} />

### Custom Delay

<Canvas of={FadeUpStories.WithLongDelay} />

## Notes

- The FadeUp component uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when the content enters the viewport.
- For the best performance, avoid nesting FadeUp components or using them for very small elements.
